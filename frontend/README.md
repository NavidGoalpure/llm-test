# Bedrock Chat Frontend

A simple React application for interacting with Amazon Bedrock AI models through a Lambda API.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

2. Update the API endpoint:
Open `src/App.js` and replace the `API_ENDPOINT` value with your actual API Gateway endpoint.

3. Start the development server:
```
npm start
```

## Building for Production

```
npm run build
```

This will create a production build in the `build` folder that can be deployed to a static hosting service.
